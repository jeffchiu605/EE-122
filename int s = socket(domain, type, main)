int s = socket(domain, type, main)

# Application. Binds as a Server.

# My sockets.
# choose o port number

# specify wihch port you want.
#sin_port
# only worry the one that we need. 


#passive and active users.
#the one that opens the server, listen and server
# Connection setup.  we want to seprate all the sockes.

We spilt into several different sockets.
100 sockets to different person taht I have.   



Does that mean that we have different socket? 
We can connect with multiple sockets. Great. now connection.
Copy data,  the only difference btw client and server is the thing. 



#Python. Socket program.
"""
Call bind,
call listen
parameter = how many people I can send at one time. You need a lot of server for many sockets.

Source -> destination function.  Then you know how.

server.accept() 

data = s.rec()

server.close 

What's the cool function here.  Inputready.

we copy
What select does. it scan through, and copy the new one into the vector.  Somebody sends th new data packet.  

The reason that it's important, we know it's awesome. 


Wait for input. accept and Recv are blocking. 
"""

Here's how it works. add server fd.
Wait for read on any 

I'm going to call accept, and I am going to add it into the vecotr. (add)
Now, we call it again, iteration loop, someone sends me a data, then we will use it and again.

This is the structure and what it looks like.

SSH into the thing. T

s.accept.receive,
s.connect((10,0,0,150000))
s.send("Hello Server")
s.close
